This is an example of the <b>DUET</b> algorithm of blind source separation of sppech signals.
<p>To check the examples run main in <b>Duet_1.java</b>
It will generate a 3D histogram of the joint distribution of time delay and amplitude ratios between the microphones.
By analizing the cluster one can establish a separation criteria based on time difference and amplitude ratio 
typical for each source.
